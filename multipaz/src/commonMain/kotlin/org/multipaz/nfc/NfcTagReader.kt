     * Scans a NFC tag.
     *
     * When a tag is in the field, [tagInteractionFunc] is called and is passed a [NfcIsoTag] which can be
     * used to communicate with the remote tag (using [NfcIsoTag.transceive]) and update the message shown in
     * the dialog (using [NfcIsoTag.updateDialogMessage]. The latter is useful if the transaction is expected
     * to take a long time, for example if reading data from a passport this can be used to convey the progress.
     *
     * If the given [tagInteractionFunc] returns `null` then polling is restarted, the session is kept alive,
     * the dialog stays visible, and the function may be called again if another tag enters the field.
     *
     * Otherwise if [tagInteractionFunc] is done interrogating the tag it must call [NfcIsoTag.close] and
     * return a value. If this happens the session ends, a brief success indication is displayed, the dialog is
     * removed, and the return value of [tagInteractionFunc] is returned.
     *
     * If [tagInteractionFunc] is not done interrogating the tag but wishes to defer processing to later, it may
     * return a value (which must include a reference to the tag) and the return value of [tagInteractionFunc]
     * is returned. When eventually done with the tag, [NfcIsoTag.close] must be called to release resources.
     * Depending on the platform the dialog may be kept visible, for example this is true on iOS where the
     * dialog is drawn by the operating system.
     *
     * If [tagInteractionFunc] throws an exception which isn't [NfcTagLostException] the message in
     * the [Throwable] is briefly displayed in the dialog with an error indication, and the exception is
     * rethrown. If [NfcTagLostException] is thrown, the behavior is the same as if [tagInteractionFunc]
     * returns `null`, that is, the dialog is kept visible so the user can scan another tag.
     * This behavior is to properly handle emulated tags - such as on Android - which may be showing
     * disambiguation UI if multiple applications have registered for the same AID.
     *
     * If the [message] parameter is `null` no user dialog is shown but everything else works as expected
     * and scanning will continue until the view-model holding [org.multipaz.prompt.PromptModel] is cleared
     * or programmatically dismissed by canceling the coroutine this is launched from.
     *
     * @param message the message to initially show in the dialog or `null` to not show a dialog. Not all
     *   platforms supports not showing a dialog, use [dialogAlwaysShown] to check at runtime
     *   if the platform supports this.
     * @param tagInteractionFunc the function which is called when the tag is in the field, see above.
     * @param context the [CoroutineContext] to use for calls to the tag which blocks the calling thread.
     * @return return value of [tagInteractionFunc]
     * @throws PromptDismissedException if the user canceled the dialog
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if [message] is `null` and [dialogAlwaysShown] is `true`.
     * @throws Throwable exceptions thrown in [tagInteractionFunc] are rethrown.
